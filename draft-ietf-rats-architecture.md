--- abstract

In network protocol exchanges, it is often the case that
one entity (a relying party) requires evidence about a remote peer to assess the peer's
trustworthiness, and a way to appraise such evidence. The evidence is typically a set of claims
about its software and hardware platform. This document describes an architecture for such
remote attestation procedures (RATS).

# Privacy Considerations

The conveyance of Evidence and the resulting Attestation Results
reveal a great deal of information about the internal state of a
device.  In many cases, the whole point of the Attestation process is
to provide reliable information about the type of the device and the
firmware/software that the device is running.  This information is
particularly interesting to many attackers. For example, knowing that a device is
running a weak version of firmware provides a way to aim
attacks better.

Protocols that convey Evidence or Attestation Results are responsible for
detailing what kinds of information are disclosed, and to whom they are exposed.

# Security Considerations

Any solution that conveys information used for security purposes, whether
such information is in the form of Evidence, Attestation Results, or
Endorsements, or Appraisal Policy, needs to support end-to-end integrity protection
and replay attack prevention, and often also needs to support additional
security protections.  For example, additional means of authentication,
confidentiality, integrity, replay, denial of service and privacy
protection are needed in many use cases.

To evaluate the security provided by a particular Appraisal Policy, it
is important to understand the strength of the Root of Trust, e.g.,
whether it is mutable software, or firmware that is read-only after
boot, or immutable hardware/ROM.

It is also important that the Appraisal Policy was itself obtained
securely.  As such, if Appraisal Policy in a Relying Party or Verifier
can be configured via a network protocol, the ability to attest to
the health of the client providing the Appraisal Policy needs to be
considered.

# IANA Considerations
