--- abstract

In network protocol exchanges, it is often the case that
one entity (a relying party) requires evidence about a remote peer to assess the peer's
trustworthiness, and a way to appraise such evidence. The evidence is typically a set of claims
about its software and hardware platform. This document describes an architecture for such
remote attestation procedures (RATS).

# Introduction

# Terminology {#terminology}

The document defines the term "Remote Attestation" as follows: A process by
which one entity (the "Attester") provides evidence about its identity and
state to another remote entity (the "Relying Party"), which then assesses the
Attester's trustworthiness for the Relying Party's own purposes.

This document then uses the following terms:

* Appraisal Policy for Evidence: A set of rules that direct how a Verifier evaluates the validity of information about an Attester.      Compare /security policy/ in \[RFC4949\].

* Appraisal Policy for Attestation Result: A set of rules that direct how a Relying Party uses the evaluation results about an Attester generated by the Verifiers. Compare /security policy/ in \[RFC4949\].

* Attestation Result: The evaluation results generated by a Verifier, typically including information about an Attester, where the Verifier vouches for the validity of the results.

* Attester: An entity whose attributes must be evaluated in order to determine whether the entity is considered trustworthy, such as when deciding whether the entity is authorized to perform some operation.

* Endorsement: A secure statement that some entity (typically a manufacturer) vouches for the integrity of an Attester's signing capability.

* Endorser: An entity that creates Endorsements that can be used to help evaluate trustworthiness of Attesters.

* Evidence: A set of information about an Attester that is to be evaluated by a Verifier.

* Relying Party: An entity that depends on the validity of information about another entity, typically for purposes of authorization.  Compare /relying party/ in \[RFC4949\].

* Relying Party Owner: An entity, such as an administrator, that is authorized to configure Appraisal Policy for Attestation Results in a Relying Party.

* Verifier: An entity that evaluates the validity of Evidence about an Attester.

* Verifier Owner: An entity, such as an administrator, that is authorized to configure Appraisal Policy for Evidence in a Verifier.

\[EDITORIAL NOTE\]

The term Attestation and Remote Attestation are not defined in this
document, at this time.  This document will include pointers to industry
uses of the terms, in an attempt to gain consensus around the term, and be
consistent with the charter text defining this term.



# Reference Use Cases {#referenceusecases}

An Attester creates Evidence that is conveyed to a Verifier.

The Verifier uses the Evidence, and any Endorsements from Endorsers,
by applying an Evidence Appraisal Policy to assess the trustworthiness of the Attester,
and generates Attestation Results for use by Relying Parties.  The Evidence Appraisal Policy
might be obtained from an Endorser along with the Endorsements, or might be obtained
via some other mechanism such as being configured in the Verifier by an administrator.

The Relying Party uses Attestation Results by applying its own
Appraisal Policy to make application-specific decisions such as authorization decisions.
The Attestation Result Appraisal Policy might, for example, be configured in the Relying Party 
by an administrator.

# Topological Models {#overview}

    <this section can include Message Flows from draft-birkholz-rats-architecture and
    Architectural Models from draft-thaler-rats-architecture>

# Two Types of Environments

An Attester consists of at least one Attesting Environment and Attested Environment.
In some implementations, the Attesting and Attested Environments might be combined.
Other implementations might have multiple Attesting and Attested Environments.

# Trust Model

The scope of this document is scenarios for which a Relying Party
trusts a Verifier that can evaluate the trustworthiness of
information about an Attester.  Such trust might come by the Relying
Party trusting the Verifier (or its public key) directly, or might
come by trusting an entity (e.g., a Certificate Authority) that is
in the Verifier's certificate chain.  The Relying Party
might implicitly trust a Verifier (such as in the Verifying Relying
Party combination).  Or, for a stronger level of security, the
Relying Party might require that the Verifier itself provide
information about itself that the Relying Party can use to evaluate
the trustworthiness of the Verifier before accepting its Attestation Results.

In solutions following the background-check model, the Attester is
assumed to trust the Verifier (again, whether directly or indirectly
via a Certificate Authority that it trusts), since the Attester
relies on an Attestation Result it obtains from the Verifier, in
order to access resources.

The Verifier trusts (or more specifically, the Verifier's security
policy is written in a way that configures the Verifier to trust) a
manufacturer, or the manufacturer's hardware, so as to be able to
evaluate the trustworthiness of that manufacturer's devices.  In solutions
with weaker security, a Verifier might be configured to implicitly
trust firmware or even software (e.g., a hypervisor).  That is, it
might evaluate the trustworthiness of an application component, or operating
system component or service, under the assumption that information
provided about it by the lower-layer hypervisor or firmware is true.
A stronger level of security comes when information can be vouched
for by hardware or by ROM code, especially if such hardware is
physically resistant to hardware tampering.  The component that is
implicitly trusted is often referred to as a Root of Trust.

# Freshness

# Privacy Considerations

The conveyance of Evidence and the resulting Attestation Results
reveal a great deal of information about the internal state of a
device.  In many cases, the whole point of the Attestation process is
to provide reliable information about the type of the device and the
firmware/software that the device is running.  This information is
particularly interesting to many attackers. For example, knowing that a device is
running a weak version of firmware provides a way to aim
attacks better.

Protocols that convey Evidence or Attestation Results are responsible for
detailing what kinds of information are disclosed, and to whom they are exposed.
