--- abstract

In network protocol exchanges, it is often the case that
one entity (a relying party) requires evidence about a remote peer to assess the peer's
trustworthiness, and a way to appraise such evidence. The evidence is typically a set of claims
about its software and hardware platform. This document describes an architecture for such
remote attestation procedures (RATS).

# Introduction

# Terminology {#terminology}

    <this section can include content from Terminology in draft-birkholz-rats-architecture
    and draft-thaler-rats-architecture>

# Reference Use Cases {#referenceusecases}

    <unclear if the WG wants this section in the arch doc>

# Topological Models {#overview}

    <this section can include Message Flows from draft-birkholz-rats-architecture and
    Architectural Models from draft-thaler-rats-architecture>

# Two Types of Environments

    <this section can include Two Types of Environments content from draft-birkholz-rats-architecture
    but can we find a better name? also this could be a subsection of something else?>

# Trust Model

    <this section can include Trust Model content from draft-thaler-rats-architecture, and
    content from Roles section in draft-birkholz-rats-architecture>

# Conceptual Messages {#messages}

    <this section can include content from Serialization Formats and Conceptual Messages sections from
    draft-thaler-rats-architecture, and Role Messages content from draft-birkholz-rats-architecture>

    ## Working with Multiple Attestation Evidence Formats

    Verifiers may support Evidence formats besides the preferred EAT format. To reduce unnecessary complexity in Relying Parties it is recommended that Verifier and Relying Party standardize on the EAT token format for Attestation Results.

# Contributors

Thomas Hardjono created older versions of the terminology section in collaboration with Ned Smith.
Eric Voit provided the conceptual separation between Attestation Provision Flows and Attestation Evidence Flows.
Monty Wisemen created the content structure of the first three architecture drafts.
Carsten Bormann provided many of the motivational building blocks with respect to the Internet Threat Model.
