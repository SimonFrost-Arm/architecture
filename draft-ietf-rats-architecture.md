--- abstract

In network protocol exchanges, it is often the case that
one entity (a Relying Party) requires evidence about a remote peer to assess the peer's
trustworthiness, and a way to appraise such evidence. The evidence is typically a set of claims
about its software and hardware platform. This document describes an architecture for such
remote attestation procedures (RATS).

--- middle

# Introduction

In Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS), one peer (the "Attester")
produces believable information about itself - Evidence - to enable
a remote peer (the "Relying Party") to decide whether to consider that
Attester a trustworthy peer or not.
RATS are facilitated by an additional vital party, the Verifier.
The Verifier appraises Evidence via Appraisal Policies and creates the
Attestation Results to support Relying Parties in their decision
process.

This documents defines a flexible architecture with corresponding roles
and their interaction via conceptual messages. Additionally, this document
defines a universal set of terms that can be mapped to various existing
and emerging Remote Attestation Procedures. Common role compositions and
data flows, such as the "Passport Model" and the "Background-Check Model"
are illustrated to enable readers of this document to map their current
and emerging solutions to the architecture provided and the corresponding
terminology defined. A common terminology that provides a well-understood semantic meaning to
the concepts, roles, and models in this document is vital to create
semantic interoperability between solutions and across different platforms.

Amongst other things, this document is about trust and trustworthiness.
Trust is a decision being made. Trustworthiness is a quality that is
assessed via evidence created. This is a subtle difference and being
familiar with the difference is crucial for using this document.
Additionally, the concepts of freshness and trust relationships with
respect to RATS are elaborated on to enable implementers in order to choose
appropriate solutions to compose their Remote Attestation Procedures.

# Terminology {#terminology}

This document uses the following terms.

Appraisal Policy for Evidence:

: A set of rules that direct how a Verifier evaluates the validity of information about an Attester. Compare /security policy/ in {{RFC4949}}

Appraisal Policy for Attestation Result:

: A set of rules that direct how a Relying Party uses the Attestation Results regarding an Attester generated by the Verifiers. Compare /security policy/ in {{RFC4949}}

Attestation Result:

: The output generated by a Verifier, typically including information about an Attester, where the Verifier vouches for the validity of the results

Attester:

: An entity whose attributes must be appraised in order to determine whether the entity is considered trustworthy, such as when deciding whether the entity is authorized to perform some operation

Claim:
: A piece of asserted information, often in the form of a name/value pair.
(Compare /claim/ in {{RFC7519}})

Endorsement:

: A secure statement that some entity (typically a manufacturer) vouches for the integrity of an Attester's signing capability

Endorser:

: An entity that creates Endorsements that can be used to help to appraise the trustworthiness of Attesters

Evidence:

: A set of information about an Attester that is to be appraised by a Verifier

Relying Party:

: An entity that depends on the validity of information about another entity, typically for purposes of authorization.  Compare /relying party/ in {{RFC4949}}

Relying Party Owner:

: An entity, such as an administrator, that is authorized to configure Appraisal Policy for Attestation Results in a Relying Party.

Verifier:

: An entity that appraises the validity of Evidence about an Attester

Verifier Owner:

: An entity, such as an administrator, that is authorized to configure Appraisal Policy for Evidence in a Verifier

# Reference Use Cases {#referenceusecases}

This section covers a number of representative use cases for remote attestation, independent of specific
solutions.  The purpose is to provide motivation for various aspects of the
architecture presented in this draft.  Many other use cases exist, and this
document does not intend to have a complete list, only to have a set of use
cases that collectively cover all the functionality required in the architecture.

Each use case includes a description, and a summary of what an Attester and a Relying
Party refer to in the use case.

## Network Endpoint Assessment

Network operators want a trustworthy report of identity
and version of information of the hardware and software on the
machines attached to their network, for purposes such as inventory,
auditing, and/or logging.  The network operator may also want a policy
by which full access is only granted to devices that meet some definition
of health, and so wants to get claims about such information and verify
their validity. Remote attestation is desired to prevent vulnerable or
compromised devices from getting access to the network and potentially
harming others.

Typically, solutions start with a specific component (called a "Root of Trust") that
provides device identity and protected storage for measurements.
These components perform a series of measurements, and express this with Evidence as to the
hardware and firmware/software that is running.

~~~
    FIXME from Henk: Measurements at early stages of
    Layered Attestation are NOT evidence yet.
    This text does not cover that yet
~~~

Attester:

: A device desiring access to a network

Relying Party:

: A network infrastructure device such as a router, switch, or access point

## Confidential Machine Learning (ML) Model Protection

A device manufacturer wants to protect its intellectual property
in terms of the ML model it developed and that runs in the devices that its
customers purchased, and it wants to prevent attackers, potentially including
the customer themselves, from seeing the details of the model.

This typically works by having some protected environment
in the device attest to some manufacturer service.  If remote attestation succeeds,
then the manufacturer service releases either the model, or a key to decrypt
a model the Attester already has in encrypted form, to the requester.

Attester:

: A device desiring to run an ML model to do inferencing

Relying Party:

: A server or service holding ML models it desires to protect

## Confidential Data Retrieval

This is a generalization of the ML model use case above, where
the data can be any highly confidential data, such as health data
about customers, payroll data about employees, future business plans, etc.
Attestation is desired to prevent leaking data to compromised devices.

Attester:

: An entity desiring to retrieve confidential data

Relying Party:

: An entity that holds confidential data for retrieval by other entities

## Critical Infrastructure Control

In this use case, potentially dangerous physical equipment
(e.g., power grid, traffic control, hazardous chemical processing, etc.)
is connected to a network.  The organization managing such infrastructure
needs to ensure that only authorized code and users can control such
processes, and they are protected from malware or other adversaries.
When a protocol operation can affect some critical
system, the device attached to the critical equipment thus wants some
assurance that the requester has not been compromised.  As such,
remote attestation can be used to only accept commands from requesters
that are within policy.

Attester:

: A device or application wishing to control physical equipment

Relying Party:

: A device or application connected to potentially dangerous physical
equipment (hazardous chemical processing, traffic control, power grid,
etc.)

## Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Provisioning

A "Trusted Application Manager (TAM)" server is responsible
for managing the applications running in the TEE of a client device.
To do this, the TAM wants to assess the state of a TEE, or of applications
in the TEE, of a client device.  The TEE attests to the TAM, which can
then decide whether the TEE is already in compliance with the TAM's latest
policy, or if the TAM needs to uninstall, update, or install approved
applications in the TEE to bring it back into compliance with the TAM's policy.

Attester:

: A device with a trusted execution environment capable of
running trusted applications that can be updated

Relying Party:

: A Trusted Application Manager

## Hardware Watchdog

One significant problem is malware that holds a device
hostage and does not allow it to reboot to prevent updates to be
applied.  This is a significant problem, because it allows a fleet
of devices to be held hostage for ransom.

A hardware watchdog can be implemented by forcing a reboot unless
remote attestation to a server succeeds within a periodic interval,
and having the reboot do remediation by bringing a device into
compliance, including installation of patches as needed.

Attester:

: The device that is desired to keep from being held hostage for
a long period of time

Relying Party:

: A remote server that will securely grant the Attester
permission to continue operating (i.e., not reboot) for a period of time

# Architectural Overview

{{dataflow}} depicts the data that flows between different roles, independent of protocol or use case.

{:dataflow: artwork-align="center"}
~~~~ WHOLEFLOW
{::include dataflow.txt}
~~~~
{:dataflow #dataflow title="Conceptual Data Flow"}

An Attester creates Evidence that is conveyed to a Verifier.

The Verifier uses the Evidence, and any Endorsements from Endorsers,
by applying an Evidence Appraisal Policy to assess the trustworthiness of the Attester,
and generates Attestation Results for use by Relying Parties.  The Evidence Appraisal Policy
might be obtained from an Endorser along with the Endorsements, or might be obtained
via some other mechanism such as being configured in the Verifier by an
administrator.

The Relying Party uses Attestation Results by applying its own
Appraisal Policy to make application-specific decisions such as authorization decisions.
The Attestation Result Appraisal Policy might, for example, be configured in the Relying Party
by an administrator.

## Appraisal Policies

The Verifier, when appraising Evidence, or the Relying Party, when
appraising Attestation Results, checks the values of some claims
against constraints specified in its Appraisal Policy.  Such constraints might
involve a comparison for equality against a reference value, or a check for being in
a range bounded by reference values, or membership in a set of reference values,
or a check against values in other claims, or any other test.

Such reference values might be specified as part of the Appraisal Policy itself,
or might be obtained from a separate source, such as an Endorsement, and then used by
the Appraisal Policy.

The actual data format and semantics of any reference values are specific to
claims and implementations. This architecture document does not define any
general purpose format for them or general means for comparison.

## Two Types of Environments of an Attester

An Attester consists of at least one Attesting Environment and at least one
Target Environment. In some implementations, the Attesting and Target Environments
might be combined.
Other implementations might have multiple Attesting and Target Environments,
such as in the examples described in more detail in {{layered-attestation}}
and {{compositedevice}}.  Other examples may exist, and the examples
discussed could even be combined into even more complex implementations.

Claims are collected from Target Environments, as shown in {{twotypes-env}}.
That is, Attesting Environments collect the raw values and
the information to be represented in claims, such as by doing some
measurement of a Target Environment's code, memory, and/or registers.
Attesting Environments then format the claims appropriately, and typically
use key material and
cryptographic functions, such as signing or cipher algorithms, to
create Evidence.
Places that Attesting Environments can exist
include Trusted  Execution Environments (TEE), embedded Secure Elements
(eSE), and BIOS firmware.
An execution environment may not, by default, be capable of claims collection
for a given Target Environment.
Attesting Environments are designed specifically with claims collection in mind.

## Layered Attestation Procedures {#layered-attestation}

By definition, the Attester role takes on the duty to create Evidence.
The fact that an Attester role is composed of several types of environments that
can be nested or staged adds complexity to the architectural layout of how an
Attester -- in itself -- is composed and therefore has to conduct the Claims collection
in order to create believable Attestation Evidence.
The following example is intended to illustrate this composition:

A very common example is elaborated on to illustrate Layered Attestation.
{:layered: artwork-align="center"}
~~~~ LAYERED
{::include layered-attester.txt}
~~~~
{:layered #layered title="Layered Attester"}

The very first Attesting Environment has to ensure the integrity of
the (U)EFI / BIOS / Firmware that initially boots up a composite device (e.g.,
a cell phone).

~~~
    Henk: we are looking for a better term than UEFI/BIOS/Firmware
~~~

These Claims have to be measured securely.
At this stage of the boot-cycle of a
composite device, the Claims collected typically cannot be composed into Evidence.

The very first Attesting Environment in this example can be a hardware component that is a Static Code Root of Trust.
As in any other scenario, this hardware component is the first Attesting Environment.
It collects a rather concise number of Claims about the Target Environment.
The Target Environment in this example is the (U)EFI / BIOS / Firmware
After the boot sequence started, the Target Environment conducts the
most important and defining feature of Layered Attestation:
The successfully measured environment that is the
(U)EFI / BIOS / Firmware now becomes the Attesting Environment.
Analogously, the Attesting Environment hands off its duty to one of its Target Environments. This procedure in Layered Attestation is called Staging.

Now, the duties have been transferred and Layered Attestation takes place.
The initial Attesting Environment relinquishes its duties to the Target Environment.
It is important to note that the new Attesting Environment cannot alter
the content about its own measurements. If the Attesting Environment
would be able to do that, Layered Attestation would become unfeasible.

In this example the duty of being the Attesting Environment is now
taken over by the (U)EFI / BIOS / Firmware that was the Attested
Environment before. This transfer of duty is the essential part of
Layered Attestation. The (U)EFI / BIOS / Firmware now is the Attesting Environment.
The next Target Environment is, in this example, a bootloader. There are
potentially multiple kernels to boot, the decision is up to the bootloader.
Only a bootloader with intact integrity will make an appropriate decision. Therefore, Claims about
the integrity of a bootloader are now collected by the freshly appointed Attesting Environment
that is the (U)EFI / BIOS / Firmware. Collected Claims have to be stored by the current
Attesting Environment in a similar shielded and secured manner, so that the next Attesting Environment
is not capable of altering the collection of claims stored.

Continuing with this example, the bootloader is now in charge of collecting Claims
about the next execution environment. The next execution environment in this example
is the kernel to be booted up. Analogously, the next transfer of duties in this
Layered Attestation example occurs: The duty of being an Attesting Environment is
transferred to a successfully measured kernel. In this sequence, the kernel is now collecting
additional Claims and is storing them in a secure and shielded manner.

~~~
    [Henk: we might have to define what successful
    means in this example and beyond]
~~~

The essence of this example is a cascade of staged boot environments. Each
environment (after the initial one that is a root-of-trust) has the duty
of measuring its next environment before it is started. Therefore, creating
a layered boot sequence and correspondingly enabling Layered Attestation.

## Composite Device {#compositedevice}

A Composite Device is an entity composed of multiple sub-entities such that its
trustworthiness has to be determined by the appraisal of all these sub-entities.

Each sub-entity has at least one Attesting Environment collecting the claims
from at least one Target Environment, then this sub-entity generates Evidence
about its trustworthiness. Therefore each sub-entity can be called an Attester.
Among all the Attesters, there may be only some which have the ability to communicate
with the Verifier while others do not.

For example, a carrier-grade router consists of a chassis and multiple slots.
The trustworthiness of the router depends on all its slots' trustworthiness.
Each slot has an Attesting Environment such as a TEE collecting the
claims of its boot process, after which it generates Evidence from the claims.
Among these slots, only a main slot can communicate with the Verifier
while other slots cannot. But other slots can communicate with the main
slot by the links between them inside the router. So the main slot collects
the Evidence of other slots, produces the final Evidence of the whole router and
conveys the final Evidence to the Verifier. Therefore the router is a Composite
Device, each slot is an Attester, and the main slot is the lead Attester.

Another example is a multi-chassis router composed of multiple single carrier-grade routers.
The multi-chassis router provides higher throughput by interconnecting
multiple routers and can be logically treated as one router for simpler management.
Among these routers, there is only one main router that connects to the Verifier.
Other routers are only connected to the main router by the network cables,
and therefore they are managed and appraised via this main router's help.
So, in this case, the multi-chassis router is the Composite Device,
each router is an Attester and the main router is the lead Attester.

{{composite}} depicts the conceptual data flow for a Composite Device.

~~~~ COMPOSITE
{::include composite-attester.txt}
~~~~
{: #composite title="Conceptual Data Flow for a Composite Device"}

In the Composite Device, each Attester generates its own Evidence by its
Attesting Environment(s) collecting the claims from its Target Environment(s).
The lead Attester collects the Evidence of all other Attesters and then
generates the Evidence of the whole Composite Attester.

An entity can take on multiple RATS roles (e.g., Attester, Verifier, Relying
Party, etc.) at the same time. The combination of roles can be arbitrary.
For example, in this Composite Device scenario, the entity inside
the lead Attester can also take on the role of a Verifier, and the
outside entity of Verifier can take on the role of a Relying Party.
After collecting the Evidence of other Attesters, this inside Verifier
verifies them using Endorsements and Appraisal Policies (obtained the
same way as any other Verifier), to generate Attestation Results.
The inside Verifier then conveys the Attestation Results of other Attesters,
whether in the same conveyance protocol as the Evidence or not,
to the outside Verifier.

In this situation, the trust model described in {{trustmodel}} is also suitable for this inside Verifier.

# Topological Models {#overview}

{{dataflow}} shows a basic model for communication between an Attester,
a Verifier, and a Relying Party. The Attester conveys its Evidence to the Verifier
for appraisal, and the Relying Party gets the Attestation Results from the Verifier.
There are multiple other possible models. This section includes some reference models,
but this is not intended to be a restrictive list, and other variations may exist.

## Passport Model

In this model, an Attester conveys Evidence to a Verifier, which compares
the Evidence against its Appraisal Policy.  The Verifier then gives back
an Attestation Result.  If the Attestation Result was a successful one,
the Attester can then present the Attestation Result to a Relying Party,
which then compares the Attestation Result against its own Appraisal Policy.

There are three ways in which the process may fail.  First, the Verifier may
refuse to issue the Attestation Result due to some error in processing, or
some missing input to the Verifier.
The second way in which the process may fail is when the resulting Result is
examined by the Relying Party, and based upon the Appraisal Policy, the
result does not pass the policy.
The third way is when the Verifier is unreachable.

Since the resource access protocol between the Attester and Relying Party
includes an Attestation Result, in this model the details of that protocol
constrain the serialization format of the Attestation Result. The
format of the Evidence on the other hand is only constrained by the
Attester-Verifier remote attestation protocol.

{: #passport title="Passport Model"}

The passport model is so named because of its resemblance to how nations issue
passports to their citizens. The nature of the Evidence that an individual needs
to provide to its local authority is specific to the country involved. The citizen
retains control of the resulting passport document and presents it to other entities
when it needs to assert a citizenship or identity claim, such as an airport immigration
desk. The passport is considered sufficient because it vouches for the citizenship and
identity claims, and it is issued by a trusted authority. Thus, in this immigration
desk analogy, the passport issuing agency is a Verifier, the passport is an Attestation
Result, and the immigration desk is a Relying Party.

## Background-Check Model

In this model, an Attester conveys Evidence to a Relying Party, which simply
passes it on to a Verifier.  The Verifier then compares the Evidence against
its Appraisal Policy, and returns an Attestation Result to the Relying Party.
The Relying Party then compares the Attestation Result against its own
appraisal policy.

The resource access protocol between the Attester and Relying Party
includes Evidence rather than an Attestation Result, but that Evidence is
not processed by the Relying Party.  Since the Evidence is merely forwarded
on to a trusted Verifier, any serialization format can be used
for Evidence because the Relying Party does not need a parser for it.
The only requirement is that the Evidence can be *encapsulated in* the format
required by the resource access protocol between the Attester and Relying Party.

However, like in the Passport model, an Attestation Result is still consumed by the
Relying Party and so the serialization format of the Attestation Result is still
important.  If the Relying Party is a constrained node whose purpose is to serve
a given type resource using a standard resource access protocol, it already needs
the parser(s) required by that existing protocol.  Hence, the ability to let the
Relying Party obtain an Attestation Result in the same serialization format allows
minimizing the code footprint and attack surface area of the Relying Party, especially
if the Relying Party is a constrained node.

{: #backgroundcheck title="Background-Check Model"}

The background-check model is so named because of the resemblance of how employers and volunteer
organizations perform background checks. When a prospective employee provides claims about
education or previous experience, the employer will contact the respective institutions or
former employers to validate the claim. Volunteer organizations often perform police background
checks on volunteers in order to determine the volunteer's trustworthiness.
Thus, in this analogy, a prospective volunteer is an Attester, the organization is the Relying Party,
and a former employer or government agency that issues a report is a Verifier.

## Combinations

One variation of the background-check model is where the Relying Party
and the Verifier on the same machine, and so there is no need for a protocol between the two.

It is also worth pointing out that the choice of model is generally up to the Relying Party,
and the same device may need to create Evidence for different Relying Parties and different use cases
(e.g., a network infrastructure device to gain access to the network, and then a
server holding confidential data to get access to that data).  As such, both models may
simultaneously be in use by the same device.

{{combination}} shows another example of a combination where Relying Party 1 uses the
passport model, whereas Relying Party 2 uses an extension of the background-check model.
Specifically, in addition to the basic functionality shown in {{backgroundcheck}}, Relying Party 2
actually provides the Attestation Result back to the Attester, allowing the Attester to
use it with other Relying Parties.  This is the model that the Trusted Application Manager
plans to support in the TEEP architecture {{-teep-arch}}.

# Trust Model {#trustmodel}

The scope of this document is scenarios for which a Relying Party
trusts a Verifier that can appraise the trustworthiness of
information about an Attester.  Such trust might come by the Relying
Party trusting the Verifier (or its public key) directly, or might
come by trusting an entity (e.g., a Certificate Authority) that is
in the Verifier's certificate chain.  The Relying Party
might implicitly trust a Verifier (such as in the Verifying Relying
Party combination).  Or, for a stronger level of security, the
Relying Party might require that the Verifier itself provide
information about itself that the Relying Party can use to assess
the trustworthiness of the Verifier before accepting its Attestation Results.

The Endorser and Verifier Owner may need to trust the Verifier
before giving the Endorsement and Appraisal Policy to it.
Such trust can also be established directly or indirectly,
implicitly or explicitly. One explicit way to establish such trust
may be the Verifier first acts as an Attester and creates Evidence about itself to be consumed by the
Endorser and/or Verifier Owner as the Relying Parties.
If it is accepted as trustworthy, then they can provide Endorsements
and Appraisal Policies that enable it to act as a Verifier.

The Verifier trusts (or more specifically, the Verifier's security
policy is written in a way that configures the Verifier to trust) a
manufacturer, or the manufacturer's hardware, so as to be able to
appraise the trustworthiness of that manufacturer's devices.  In solutions
with weaker security, a Verifier might be configured to implicitly
trust firmware or even software (e.g., a hypervisor).  That is, it
might appraise the trustworthiness of an application component, or operating
system component or service, under the assumption that information
provided about it by the lower-layer hypervisor or firmware is true.
A stronger level of security comes when information can be vouched
for by hardware or by ROM code, especially if such hardware is
physically resistant to hardware tampering.  The component that is
implicitly trusted is often referred to as a Root of Trust.

In some scenarios, Evidence might contain sensitive information such as
Personally Identifiable Information.
Thus, an Attester must trust entities to which it conveys Evidence, to not
reveal sensitive data to unauthorized parties.
The Verifier might share this information with other authorized parties, according rules that it controls.
In the background-check model, this Evidence may also be revealed to Relying Party(s).


# Conceptual Messages {#messages}

## Evidence

Evidence is a set of claims about the target environment that reveal operational
status, health, configuration or construction that have security relevance.
Evidence is evaluated by a Verifier to establish its relevance, compliance, and timeliness.
Claims need to be collected in a manner that is reliable.
Evidence needs to be securely associated with the target environment
so that the Verifier cannot be tricked into accepting claims originating
from a different environment (that may be more trustworthy).
Evidence also must be protected from man-in-the-middle attackers who may observe,
change or misdirect Evidence as it travels from Attester to Verifier.
The timeliness of Evidence can be captured using claims that pinpoint the time
or interval when changes in operational status, health, and so forth occur.

## Endorsements

An Endorsement is a secure statement that some entity (e.g., a manufacturer) vouches for the integrity of the
device's signing capability.  For example, if the signing capability is in hardware, then
an Endorsement might be a manufacturer certificate that signs a public key whose corresponding
private key is only known inside the device's hardware.  Thus, when Evidence and such an Endorsement
are used together, an appraisal procedure can be conducted based on Appraisal Policies that may not be specific to the
device instance, but merely specific to the manufacturer providing the Endorsement. For example,
an Appraisal Policy might simply check that devices from a given manufacturer have information
matching a set of known-good reference values, or an Appraisal Policy might have a set of more complex
logic on how to appraise the validity of information.

However, while an Appraisal Policy that treats all devices from a given manufacturer the same
may be appropriate for some use cases, it would be inappropriate to use such an Appraisal Policy
as the sole means of authorization for use cases that wish to constrain *which* compliant devices
are considered authorized for some purpose.  For example, an enterprise using remote attestation for
Network Endpoint Assessment may not wish to let every healthy laptop from the same
manufacturer onto the network, but instead only want to let devices that it legally owns
onto the network.  Thus, an Endorsement may be helpful information in authenticating
information about a device, but is not necessarily sufficient to authorize access to
resources which may need device-specific information such as a public key for the device or
component or user on the device.

## Attestation Results

Attestation Results may indicate compliance or non-compliance with a Verifier's Appraisal Policy.
A result that indicates non-compliance can be used by an Attester (in the passport model) or
a Relying Party (in the background-check model) to indicate that the Attester
should not be treated as authorized and may be in need of remediation.  In some cases,
it may even indicate that the Evidence itself cannot be authenticated as being correct.

An Attestation Result that indicates compliance can be used by a Relying Party to make
authorization decisions based on the Relying Party's Appraisal Policy.  The simplest such
policy might be to simply authorize any party supplying a compliant Attestation Result
signed by a trusted Verifier.  A more complex policy might also entail comparing information
provided in the result against known-good reference values, or applying more complex logic
on such information.

Thus, Attestation Results often need to include detailed information about the Attester,
for use by Relying Parties, much like physical passports and drivers licenses include
personal information such as name and date of birth.  Unlike Evidence, which is often
very device- and vendor-specific, Attestation Results can be vendor-neutral if the Verifier
has a way to generate vendor-agnostic information based on the appraisal of vendor-specific
information in Evidence.  This allows a Relying Party's Appraisal Policy to be simpler,
potentially based on standard ways of expressing the information, while still allowing
interoperability with heterogeneous devices.

Finally, whereas Evidence is signed by the device (or indirectly by a manufacturer, if
Endorsements are used), Attestation Results are signed by a Verifier, allowing a Relying
Party to only need a trust relationship with one entity, rather than a larger set of
entities, for purposes of its Appraisal Policy.

# Claims Encoding Formats

The following diagram illustrates a relationship to which remote attestation is desired to be added:

~~~~
   +-------------+               +------------+ Evaluate
   |             |-------------->|            | request
   |  Attester   |  Access some  |   Relying  | against
   |             |    resource   |    Party   | security
   +-------------+               +------------+ policy
~~~~
{: #clientserver title="Typical Resource Access"}

In this diagram, the protocol between Attester and a Relying Party
can be any new or existing protocol (e.g., HTTP(S), COAP(S),
802.1x, OPC UA, etc.), depending on the use case.  Such
protocols typically already have mechanisms for passing security
information for purposes of authentication and authorization.  Common
formats include JWTs {{RFC7519}}, CWTs {{RFC8392}}, and X.509 certificates.

To enable remote attestation to be added to existing protocols, enabling a higher
level of assurance against malware for example, it is important that
information needed for appraising the Attester be usable with existing
protocols that have constraints around what formats they can transport.
For example, OPC UA {{OPCUA}} (probably the most common protocol in
industrial IoT environments) is defined to carry X.509 certificates and so
security information must be embedded into an X.509 certificate to be passed
in the protocol.  Thus, remote attestation related information could be natively
encoded in X.509 certificate extensions, or could be natively encoded in
some other format (e.g., a CWT) which in turn is then encoded in an X.509
certificate extension.

Especially for constrained nodes, however, there is a desire to minimize
the amount of parsing code needed in a Relying Party, in order to both
minimize footprint and to minimize the attack surface area.  So while
it would be possible to embed a CWT inside a JWT, or a JWT inside an
X.509 extension, etc., there is a desire to encode the information
natively in the format that is natural for the Relying Party.

This motivates having a common "information model" that describes
the set of remote attestation related information in an encoding-agnostic
way, and allowing multiple encoding formats (CWT, JWT, X.509, etc.)
that encode the same information into the claims format needed by the
Relying Party.

The following diagram illustrates that Evidence and Attestation Results
might each have multiple possible encoding formats, so that they can be
conveyed by various existing protocols.  It also motivates why the Verifier
might also be responsible for accepting Evidence that encodes claims in
one format, while issuing Attestation Results that encode claims in
a different format.

# Freshness {#freshness}

It is important to prevent old Evidence or old Attestation Results that are no longer correct to be assessed as valid. Replay Attacks are an important reason to do that. More importantly, the validity of Conceptual Message, such as Evidence or Attestation Results, are the basis for trustworthy RATS, in general.
Some mechanism of ensuring that Evidence and Attestation
Results are actually fresh are required. In essence, there has to be some degree of assurance
that they still reflect the latest operational state of the Attester and that, for example, Attestation
Results were generated using the latest Appraisal Policy for Evidence.
There is, however, always a race condition possible in that the
state of the Attester, and the Appraisal Policy for Evidence,
might change immediately after the Evidence or Attestation Results were generated.
Freshness is a key component for enabling caching
and reuse of both Evidence and Attestation Results, which is especially
valuable in cases where their computation uses a substantial part of a
resource budget (e.g., an energy budget in constrained devices).
The goal is to narrow the time window to something the Verifier
(for Evidence) or Relying Party (for an Attestation Result) is willing to accept.

There are four common approaches to providing some assurance of freshness, effectively determining the epoch of the
validity-span of Evidence or Attestation Results.

## Implicit Timekeeping using Nonces

The first approach places the onus of timekeeping solely on the remote
entity (e.g., the Verifier for Evidence, or the Relying Party for an
Attestation Result).
This might be an appropriate choice in case the Attester does not have a reliable clock or time synchronisation is
otherwise impaired.
In this approach, a nonce is generated by a remote entity
(e.g., the Verifier for Evidence, or the Relying Party for an Attestation
Result), and the nonce is then signed and included along with the claims in
the Evidence or Attestation Result, so that the remote entity knows that the
claims were signed after the nonce was generated.

## Explicit Timekeeping using Synchronized Clocks

A second approach is to rely on synchronized clocks, and include a signed
timestamp along with the
claims in the Evidence or Attestation Result, so that the remote entity knows
that the claims were signed at that time, as long as it has some assurance that
the timestamp is correct.
This typically requires additional claims about
the signer's time synchronization mechanism in order to provide such assurance.
This allows associating a "rough" epoch to the Evidence or Attestation Result. 
In this case, the epoch is said to be "rough" because 
    a) it is always bound to the set of Claims as a whole, as opposed to having Claim being separately annotated, and 
    b) it is not possible to distinguish between time of collection from the time of creation of the Claims set.

## Interval Timekeeping using Nonces

A third approach is a variant of the first; the difference is that it allows
fine-grained epoch assignment.
In this approach an Attester's signature spans the nonce as well as an
Attester's trusted timetick counter(s). 
Signatures across subsequent Evidence which embeds incrementing values of
the trusted timetick counter(s) can be used to establish the time interval
which has elasped since the nonce was received.

## Distributed Interval Timekeeping using Local Clocks

A fourth approach places the onus of timekeeping on all involved parties,
but does not require the parties' clocks to be sychronized.
A centralized entity is required to distribute non-repeatable values, which are referred to as
Handles, to all involved parties in periodic intervals.
Each Handle has a validity-span with an epoch that starts at the local time of
involved parties at which a distributed handle has been received.
While only the source of the periodically sent handle must track the time interval, Attesters should also track is to avoid creating invalid Evidence when it can be avoided.
Distributed handles are used in place of a nonces for Evidence generation.
Verfiers have knowledge of the current valid
handle and keep track of its validity-span since the established epoch.
If a handle expired due to a time-out threshold, from the point of view
of Verifiers the time window of validity expired and the Evidence
cannot be considered fresh anymore.

## Claim Validity

In all approaches, it is important to note that the actual values in Claims
might have been generated long before the Claims are signed.
If so, it is the
signer's (the Attestation Environment's) responsibility to ensure that the values are still correct when they
are signed.
For example, values might have been generated at boot, and then
used in Claims as long as the signer can guarantee that they cannot have changed
since boot.

A more detailed discussion with examples is illustrated in {{time-considerations}}.

# Privacy Considerations

The conveyance of Evidence and the resulting Attestation Results
reveal a great deal of information about the internal state of a
device.  In many cases, the whole point of the Attestation process is
to provide reliable information about the type of the device and the
firmware/software that the device is running.  This information might be
particularly interesting to many attackers. For example, knowing that a device is
running a weak version of firmware provides a way to aim attacks better.

Evidence and Attestation Results data structures are expected to support
integrity protection encoding (e.g., COSE, JOSE, X.509) and optionally might
support confidentiality protection (e.g., COSE, JOSE).
Therefore, if confidentiality protection is omitted or unavailable, the protocols
that convey Evidence or Attestation Results are responsible for detailing what
kinds of information are disclosed, and to whom they are exposed.

Furthermore, because Evidence might contain sensitive information,
Attesters are responsible for only sending such Evidence to trusted
Verifiers.  Some Attesters might want a stronger level of assurance of
the trustworthiness of a Verifier before sending Evidence to it.  In such cases,
an Attester can first act as a Relying Party and ask for the Verifier's own
Attestation Result, and appraising it just as a Relying Party would appraise
an Attestation Result for any other purpose.

# Security Considerations

Any solution that conveys information used for security purposes, whether
such information is in the form of Evidence, Attestation Results,
Endorsements, or Appraisal Policy, needs to support end-to-end integrity protection
and replay attack prevention, and often also needs to support additional
security protections.  For example, additional means of authentication,
confidentiality, integrity, replay, denial of service and privacy
protection are needed in many use cases.
{{freshness}} discusses ways in which freshness can be used in this
architecture to protect against replay attacks.

To assess the security provided by a particular Appraisal Policy, it
is important to understand the strength of the Root of Trust, e.g.,
whether it is mutable software, or firmware that is read-only after
boot, or immutable hardware/ROM.

It is also important that the Appraisal Policy was itself obtained
securely.  As such, if Appraisal Policies for a Relying Party or for a Verifier
can be configured via a network protocol, the ability to create Evidence about
the integrity of the entity providing the Appraisal Policy needs to be
considered.

The security of conveyed information may be applied at different layers, whether by a conveyance protocol, or an information encoding format. This architecture expects attestation messages (i.e., Evidence, Attestation Results, Endorsements and Policies) are end-to-end protected based on the role interaction context.
For example, if an Attester produces Evidence that is relayed through some other entity that doesn't implement the Attester or the intended Verifier roles, then the relaying entity should not expect to have access to the Evidence.

# Appendix A: Time Considerations {#time-considerations}

The table below defines a number of relevant events, with an ID that
is used in subsequent diagrams.  The times of said events might be
defined in terms of an absolute clock time such as Coordinated Universal Time, 
or might be defined relative to some other timestamp or timeticks counter with different timescales.

| ID | Event                       | Explanation of event
|----|-----------------------------|-----------------------
| VG | Value generation            | A value to appear in a Claim was created.
| AA | Attester awareness          | An Attesting Environment starts to be aware of a new/changed Claim value.
| CC | Claim Collection            | An Attesting Environment collects a new/changed Claim value to appear in Evidence.
| HD | Handle distribution         | A centrally generated identifier for time-bound recentness across a domain of devices is successfully received by Attesters (and Verifiers).

| RG | Result generation           | A Verifier appraises Evidence and generates an Attestation Result.
| RP | Result push                 | A set of one or more Evidence bundles is conveyed to a Verifier with or without solicitation initially triggered by AA, in a periodic interval, or ad-hoc.
| RR | Result relayed              | A Relying Party relays an Attestation Result to a Relying Party.
| RA | Result appraised            | The Relying Party appraises Attestation Results.
| OP | Operation performed         | The Relying Party performs some operation requested by the Attester.  For example, acting upon some message just received across a session created earlier at time(RA).
| RX | Result expiry               | An Attestation Result should no longer be accepted, according to the Verifier that generated it.

Using the table above, a number of hypothetical examples of how a solution might be built are illustrated below.
a solution might be built.  This list is not intended to be complete,
but is just representative enough to highlight various timing considerations.

## Example 1: Timestamp-based Passport Model Example

The following example illustrates a hypothetical Passport Model
solution that uses timestamps and requires roughly synchronized
clocks between the Attester, Verifier, and Relying Party, which
depends on using a secure clock synchronization mechanism.

The Verifier can check whether the Evidence is fresh when appraising
it at time(RG) by checking `time(RG) - time(EG) < Threshold`, where the
Verifier's threshold is large enough to account for the maximum
permitted clock skew between the Verifier and the Attester.

If time(VG) is also included in the Evidence along with the claim value
generated at that time, and the Verifier decides that it can trust the
time(VG) value, the Verifier can also determine whether the claim value is
recent by checking `time(RG) - time(VG) < Threshold`, again where the threshold
is large enough to account for the maximum permitted clock skew between
the Verifier and the Attester.

The Relying Party can check whether the Attestation Result is fresh
when appraising it at time(RA) by checking `time(RA) - time(RG) < Threshold`,
where the Relying Party's threshold is large enough to account for the
maximum permitted clock skew between the Relying Party and the Verifier.  
The result might then be used for some time (e.g., throughout the lifetime
of a connection established at time(RA)).  The Relying Party must be
careful, however, to not allow continued use beyond the period for which
it deems the Attestation Result to remain fresh enough.  Thus,
it might allow use (at time(OP)) as long as `time(OP) - time(RG) < Threshold`.
However, if the Attestation Result contains an expiry time time(RX) then
it could explicitly check `time(OP) < time(RX)`.

solution that uses nonces and thus does not require that any clocks
are synchronized.

In this example solution, the Verifier can check whether the Evidence is
fresh at time(RG) by verifying that `time(RG) - time(NS) < Threshold`.

The Verifier cannot, however, simply rely on a Nonce to
determine whether the value of a claim is recent, since the claim value
might have been generated long before the nonce was sent by the Verifier.
However, if the Verifier decides that the Attester can be trusted to
correctly provide the delta time(EG)-time(VG), then it can determine recency
by checking `time(RG)-time(NS) + time(EG)-time(VG) < Threshold`.

Similarly if, based on an Attestation Result from a Verifier it trusts,
the Relying Party decides that the Attester can be trusted to correctly
provide time deltas, then it can determine whether the Attestation
Result is fresh by checking 
`time(OP) - time(NS') + time(RR)-time(EG) < Threshold`.
Although the Nonce2 and time(RR)-time(EG) values cannot be inside
the Attestation Result, they might be signed by the Attester such
that the Attestation Result vouches for the Attester's signing
capability.

The Relying Party must still be careful, however, to not allow continued 
use beyond the period for which it deems the Attestation Result to remain
valid.  Thus, if the Attestation Result sends a validity lifetime
in terms of time(RX)-time(RG), then the Relying Party can check
`time(OP) - time(NS') < time(RX)-time(RG)`.

## Example 3: Timestamp-based Background-Check Model Example

The following example illustrates a hypothetical Background-Check Model
solution that uses centrally generated identifiers for time-bound recentness (referred to as "handle" in this example). This example can either use centrally generated timestamps and -- and thereby require synchronized clocks between the Attester, Verifier, and Relying Party -- or other centrally generated identifiers that are distributed in periodic intervals as handles. The latter option does not require require synchronized clocks.

In comparison with example 1, the time considerations in this example go into more detail with respect to the life-cycle of Claims and Evidence.
The goal is to create up-to-date and recent Evidence as soon as possible, in general. 

At time(AA) the Attesting Environment is able to trigger an event (e.g. based on an Event-Condition-Action model) to create attestation Evidence that is as recent as possible. In essence, at time(AA) the Attesting Environment is aware of new values that where generated at time(VG) and corresponding Claim values are collected immediately. Consecutively, evidence based on relevant "old" Claims and the just collected "new" Claims is generated at time(EG).

In order to create attestation Evidence based on the event trigger
time(AA) on-demand, the Attester requires a fresh (i.e. not expired)
centrally generated identifier that was also distributed to the
Verifiers that are going to appraise the Evidence. Corresponding
identifiers could be composed of signed timestamps {{-tuda}} or other
non-repeating values, for example, relative tick-counters that reset on restart of a device can also be used.

The validity-span of a handle used for Evidence generation depends on the content-type of the handle. If it is a (relative or absolute) timestamp, clocks synchronized with a shared and trustworthy source of time are required. If another value type is used as a handle, the reception time of the handle time(HD) provides an epoch (relative time of zero) for measuring the duration of validity (similar to a heart-beat timeout). From the point of view of a Verifier, validity of Evidence is only given if the handle used in Evidence satisfies delta(time(HD),time(EG))distribution-interval.

In this usage scenario, time(VG), time(AA), and time(EG) are tightly coupled. Also, the absolute point in time at which a handle is received by all three entities is assumed to be close to identical.

## Example 4: Nonce-based Background-Check Model Example

The following example illustrates a hypothetical Background-Check Model
solution that uses nonces and thus does not require that any clocks
are synchronized.  In this example solution, a nonce is
generated by a Verifier at the request of a Relying Party, when
the Relying Party needs to send one to an Attester.

The Verifier can check whether the Evidence is fresh, and whether a claim
value is recent, the same as in Example 2 above.

However, unlike in Example 2, the Relying Party can use the Nonce to
determine whether the Attestation Result is fresh, by verifying that
`time(OP) - time(NR) < Threshold`.

The Relying Party must still be careful, however, to not allow continued 
use beyond the period for which it deems the Attestation Result to remain
valid.  Thus, if the Attestation Result sends a validity lifetime
in terms of time(RX)-time(RG), then the Relying Party can check
`time(OP) - time(ER) < time(RX)-time(RG)`.
